        <h2>My interest: Sewing</h2>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p> I love sewing because it allows me to express my creativity while making practical and beautiful items. Whether it's crafting clothes, home decorations or small accessories, sewing provides a sense of accomplishment and relaxation. It also helps me create personalized gifts for my family and my friends. <br><br> One of the reason I enjoy sewing is the endless learning opportunities. 
           From hand stitching to using a sewing machine, every project is given me a chance to improve my skills. Additionally, it's a sustainable hobby since I can mend old clothes and upcycle fabric into something new and stylish. <br><br> <mark>A relative link</mark> is a hyperlink that points to another file or location within the same website.
