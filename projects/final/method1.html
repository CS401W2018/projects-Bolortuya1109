            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Mental health encompasses our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. Just like physical health, mental health is dynamic and can fluctuate over time. Understanding the basics of mental health is the first step towards prioritizing your overall well-being and recognizing when you or someone you know might need support.</p>

            <h2>What is Mental Health?</h2>
            <p>Mental health is more than just the absence of mental illness. It's about feeling good about yourself, having healthy relationships, and being able to cope with the normal stresses of life. Good mental health allows us to be productive, contribute to our communities, and reach our full potential.</p>
