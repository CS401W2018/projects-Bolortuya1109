            <p><strong>Title:</strong> Mental Health: Awareness, Resources, and Support</p>

            <h3>Why I Chose This Topic</h3>
            <p>I chose the topic of mental health because it is an increasingly important issue in today's society, yet it is often stigmatized or misunderstood. Many individuals struggle with mental health challenges but may not have access to the support or information they need. Through this project, I hope to contribute to a more open and supportive conversation about mental health, provide resources for those in need, and break down the barriers that prevent people from seeking help.</p>
